### Story Entry Points

- Create a new resident of the Grand Hotel for the Symbolically Displaced, detailing their unique symbolic affliction and their room.
- Describe a 'thin place' in your own local area where the 'wallpaper of reality' seems to peel, using specific, sensory details.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build an interactive map of the novel's city where locations are tagged not with names but with the symbols and literary fragments that define them.
- Create a generative text tool that 'translates' a user's physical location into a beat-style prose poem, blending local details with universal themes.
